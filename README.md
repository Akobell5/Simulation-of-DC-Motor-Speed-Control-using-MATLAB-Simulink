# Simulation-of-DC-Motor-Speed-Control-using-MATLAB-Simulink
This repository contains a MATLAB Simulink simulation file for a DC motor speed control system. The simulation is designed to demonstrate the control of a DC motor's speed using a proportional-integral (PI) controller.
The DC motor speed control system consists of a DC motor, an encoder for speed measurement, a PI controller, and a reference speed input. The objective is to regulate the motor's speed based on the desired reference speed.

# The simulation file demonstrates the following:

Speed measurement using the encoder feedback.
Proportional-Integral (PI) control algorithm for speed control.
Implementation of the PI controller using appropriate blocks in Simulink.
Calculation of the control signal based on the difference between the reference speed and the measured speed.
Visual representation of the motor speed and control signal over time using scope blocks.
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open the DC_motor_speed_control.slx file in MATLAB Simulink.
Adjust the parameters, such as gains of the PI controller, to match your desired control system.
Run the simulation to observe the motor's speed response and the control signal.
# Requirements
MATLAB(2021 and above) with Simulink installed.
